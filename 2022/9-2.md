Agenda: 

Use Case Draft Updates

Authors have pulled in capability changes brought up in PR
Added domain spoofing as something missing from use cases.
Capabilities around device identity / two devices being the same.
Perhaps a scoped-down substitute for IP that is more privacy friendly
Knowledge of whether or not it’s a headless browser (trust tokens and device attestation can help)
Coordinated tactic detection
Waiting to collect additional feedback, editors will follow up in next meeting
Philip: let’s better unpack ‘retrieve device’s IP address’; what else can give us that ability?
Spreadsheet of currently enumerated capabilities and a first attempt to up-level: Capabilities enumerated
Sam/Dimitris will comment on multiple solutions to address current IP address use cases
Brian: as privacy regulations grow, location derived from IP has become more important. Perhaps those stakeholders have novel approaches or supporting approaches (as they rely on this to meet GDPR or CCPA-type local regimes)
Steven: Perhaps GPS-level is very high localization, typically only country-level is used
